# Frontend Design Skill

This skill is designed to help you create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. It emphasizes creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Core Philosophy

Avoid "AI Slop" by focusing on a clear aesthetic point-of-view. Every interface should feel intentional, meticulously refined, and production-ready.

## 1. Typography
- **Selection**: Avoid generic system fonts unless specified. Use distinctive fonts that elevate the design.
- **Hierarchy**: Establish clear typographic scales. Use varying weights, letter spacing, and line heights to create rhythm.
- **Contrast**: Use size and weight to guide the eye. Consider oversized headings for impact.

## 2. Color & Theme
- **Cohesion**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Define a primary palette and use it consistently.
- **Accents**: Use sharp, high-contrast accents for interactive elements.
- **Depth**: Use subtle color shifts and overlays to create visual interest without clutter.

## 3. Motion & Interaction
- **Micro-interactions**: Implement subtle feedback for user actions (hover, click, focus).
- **Animations**: Focus on high-impact moments. Use smooth transitions for entering/exiting states.
- **Physics**: Prefer spring-based or eased animations that feel natural and premium.

## 4. Spatial Composition
- **Layout**: Experiment with unexpected layouts and asymmetry.
- **Negative Space**: Be generous with white space to let elements breathe.
- **Alignment**: Use grids but don't be afraid to break them for visual tension.

## 5. Visual Details & Backgrounds
- **Atmosphere**: Use gradient meshes, noise textures, and layered transparencies to create depth.
- **Refinement**: Pay attention to borders, shadows, and rounded corners. Use subtle gradients for "glassmorphism" or "neubrutalism" where appropriate.
- **Contextual Effects**: Add effects that match the overall aesthetic (e.g., subtle glow for a dark mode "cyber" theme).

## 6. Implementation Guidelines (Tailwind CSS 4)
- **CSS-First**: Leverage the `@theme` directive in CSS for extending colors and fonts.
- **Modern Utilities**: Use the latest Tailwind 4 features (e.g., `bg-black/50` for opacity, `text-ellipsis`).
- **Composition**: Use utility classes to build complex visual details without heavy custom CSS.

## 7. Interaction with Flux UI
- **Customization**: Don't just use default Flux components; customize them to fit the aesthetic theme using Tailwind classes.
- **Composition**: Combine Flux components with custom layouts to achieve unique spatial compositions.
